## About this fork

This is a fork of the source NBT repo, however the focus of my changes are on the trader.ts and associated components. This is the script that receives the buy/sell signals from BVA and executes them on Binance. I have not modified the server.

The new features that I have added to the trader include:
* **CONFIG: Quantity as Fraction**
  * If enabled, this will interpret the "Quantity to Buy" that you have configured in BVA as a fraction of your total balance in [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en-AU/register?ref=141340247). E.g. if you say 0.1 BTC it will actually spend 10% of your balance on each trade. However, it will only use the balance from a single wallet, it will not add the two together. This will apply to both SHORT and LONG trades, even though SHORT will not use the actual balance. Note that both SHORT nad LONG trades will always be calculated relative the **Primary Wallet** (see below).
* **CONFIG: Funding / Auto-Balancing for LONG Trades**
  * Several options are now available for choosing where the funds come from for LONG trades. Please make sure you fully understand the implications of these before using them, as they can provide greater gains but can also cause greater losses. I suggest you even take a look at the code and understand the decisions that are being made by each model.
    * **(Default)**: This will use the available funds in margin or spot wallets, and will stop opening new trades when funds run out (low risk).
    * **Borrow Minimum**: This will use the available funds in margin or spot wallets, and will then start borrowing funds in margin to execute new trades (medium risk).
    * **Borrow All**: This will always borrow funds in margin to execute new trades regardless of available funds (high risk).
    * **Sell All**: This will use the available funds in margin or spot wallets, then re-sell a small portion of every active trade in order to free up funds for the new trades. All active trades will have the same investment. E.g. 4 active trades will use 25% of your balance each, if a 5th trade opens then it will sell a portion from the previous 4 so that all 5 trades are using 20% of your balance. However, once trades start to close it will not re-buy the remaining open trades.
    * **Sell Largest**: This will use the available funds in margin or spot wallets, then re-sell half of the largest trade. E.g. (assuming you set the quantity to 1) 1st trade will use 100% of your balance, the 2nd trade will sell 50% of the first trade and use that, the 3rd trade will sell 50% of the first trade so now you have 1st @ 25%, 2nd @ 50%, 3rd @ 25% of your total balance. The difference between this and the "All" model is that it only re-sells from a single existing trade whenever a new one comes in. This means that sometimes the trade sizes will not be equal. This also will not re-buy for remaining open trades.
  * Each model will first attempt to use the "Quantity to Buy" from BVA (either as an absolute or a fraction), this will represent the largets possible trade value. Only if there are insufficient funds, then it will apply one of the options or reduce the trade quantity.
  * The models that calculate a quantity relative to your current balance will only use the total balance from the primary wallet (margin by default). Also, if some or all of that balance is locked up in active LONG trades, it will estimate the total balance based on the original opening price of those trades (not current market price).
  * Only LONG trades consume your available balance (all SHORT trades are done through borrowing).
* **CONFIG: Primary Wallet**
  * You can choose whether to use the spot or margin wallet as your primary wallet for LONG trades. It will also use the total balance from this primary wallet to calculate the size of SHORT trades if you are using **Quantity as Fraction**.
* **Alternate Wallet Fall Back**
  * If you do not have sufficient funds in your primary wallet (e.g. margin) to make LONG trades, it will automatically try to make the trade from your other wallet (e.g. spot).
* **CONFIG: Wallet Buffer**
  * As slippage, spread, and bad trades are difficult to predict, it is good to keep some additional funds in your wallet to cover these costs. You can specify a buffer amount as a fraction of your wallet (e.g. 0.1 is 10%), which will not be used for opening LONG trades.
* **CONFIG: Maximum Count of Trades**
  * You can set maximum counts for SHORT and for LONG trades to limit how many can be active at one time. This can be used to limit your exposure to risk when borrowing, or to limit the number of times a LONG trade gets rebalanced.
* **CONFIG: Disable SHORT Trades**
  * You can choose to ignore all short trades so that no additional funds will be borrowed.
* **CONFIG: Disable Coins**
  * You can provide a comma delimited list of coins that you want to ignore trade signals for (e.g. DOGE).
* **CONFIG: Virtual Trading Balance**
  * You can set a default balance for virtual trades, this allows you to simulate some of the auto-balancing or funding models above.
* **Individual Tracking of Real/Virtual Trades**
  * In the original trader if you started a strategy in virtual trading and switched to real trading, or vice versa, it would attempt to close trades based on the current status of the strategy, rather than how the trade was originally opened. This means it could try to close a trade on Binance that was originally opened virtually, or worse, never close the open trade on Binance because you've now switched the strategy to virtual. Now, if the trade opened on Binance it will close on Binance even if the strategy has been switched to virtual. If you don't want this to happen, make sure you close or stop the open trades before switching modes.
* **Comments**
  * I've added extensive comments to the trader.ts code to (hopefully) help you understand how it works. But please feel free to find me on Discord if you have any questions.

## Technical overview üë®‚Äçüíª

<img src="docs/images/nbt_diagram.png">

NBT includes 3 main scripts:

> NOTE: If you are a first-time user and you just want to follow the existing strategies on [Bitcoin vs. Altcoins](https://bitcoinvsaltcoins.com), all you need to worry about is the **trader** script. Just follow the **[Quick start guide üöÄ](./docs/GETTING-STARTED.md)** to deploy the **trader** on Heroku. The **server** and **backtest** scripts are only needed if you want to start creating your own strategies.

* the **trader**: [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/PostmanSpat/node-binance-trader)

  * this script allows you to auto trade the signals received from the NBT hub or your own server. this script can run locally or on cloud services like Heroku. This new auto trader script allows you to trade with leverage when the pair is available for margin trading.

* the **server**:

  * to track a selection of asset pairs and record all [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en-AU/register?ref=141340247) api data (candles, depths, trades) into a Postgres database.
  * to detect buy or sell signals
  * (optional) to send trading signals to the NBT Hub / [Bitcoin vs. Altcoins](https://bitcoinvsaltcoins.com) to monitor performances and auto trade those signals (virtually or for real).

* the **backtest** :

  * to backtest your strategies on the historical tick data (Postgres database) recorded by the server.
